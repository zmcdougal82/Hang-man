This project took me the full 4 hours. Like I explained I haven't had a ton of experience programming
but it intrests me and I enjoy it. I didn't fully complete part 8 due to time. I cleaned out most
my notes in the code before realizing you wanted to evaulate them. My process throughout it began 
with using solely pop up boxes I then realized that it wouldn't work in the way I wanted it to so I
did some research and shifted to an input box. After that I spent the majority of time shifting my 
reasoning over to make it work and testing through trial and error. Its not the most beautiful or 
complex but for having limited experience and being able to get as far as I did im fairly satisfied.
Im sure with more training and time I would be able to do it with much more ease. Like I said being 
upfront is I dont have a lot of coding experience but I learn quickly, know how to find answers for
the things I dont and I'm determined.
